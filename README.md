# Todo_List


Welcome To TODO LIST 💻

“I created a simple website using JavaScript, mainly designed to help you manage and organize your daily tasks easily and effectively. The idea is that you can enter any task or something you want to do so you don’t forget it, and each task you add gets listed in the task list. Once you complete a task, you can click on it and mark it as complete, and when you’re done with it entirely, you can delete it from the list.”
